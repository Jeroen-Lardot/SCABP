								<p>SARS-CoV-2 also known as covid-19 or the coronavirus, has been continuing to hassle our everyday lives. It has been made very clear from scientist and governing bodies, that this virus is excellent at spreading and infecting, and is also deadly when infected with other illness such as diabetes. But have you ever wondered if someone who has been infected by the corona virus can get infected again? Well, scientists are also trying to find out.</p>
								<p>A case study was done investigating a 25-year-old male resident of Washoe County in the US state of Nevada was tested positive twice for SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR testing in April 18, 2020 and in June 5, 2020 while also testing negative in between the two dates (May 26, 2020). These types of reports of secondary infection events with SARS-CoV-2 are rare, and have been only published in Hong Kong, the Netherlands and Belgium, and Ecuador.</p>
								<p>Swabs collected from both the different time of infection was processed and amplified for next generation sequencing to sequence the genome of the virus and later bioinformatics analysis of the two specimens was done. short tandem repeat marker was used for fragment analysis to confirm that samples from both infections came from the same individual.</p>
								<table style="width: 100%;">
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td style="width: 50.0000%;">Next generation sequencing (NGS), describe a DNA sequencing technology which has revolutionized genomic research. Using NGS an entire human genome can be sequenced within a single day. In contrast, the previous Sanger sequencing technology, would need about a decade.<br></td>
											<td style="width: 50.0000%;">A short tandem repeat is a microsatellite (tract of repetitive DNA) with repeat units that are 2 to 7 base pairs in length, with the number of repeats varying among individuals, making STRs effective for human identification purposes<br></td>
										</tr>
									</tbody>

								<p>Possible explanation for these phenomena: 1. Continuous infection after deactivation and reactivation. Which is not likely possible due to the fact mutational rate of SARS-CoV-2 would need to far exceed to the norm. 2. Co- infection of specimen A and B, however, this possible situation would not itself account for the genotype switch observed between the first infection and reinfection. 3. Most plausible interpretation would be that the patient was infected by SARS-CoV-2 on two separate occasions by a genetically distinct virus. Thus, previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might not guarantee total immunity in all cases, and this would be important to note during development of vaccines.</p>
								<p>What does this mean to most people? Well, yes there is a chance for reinfection if one in an unfortunate event is infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, from the sparse amount of reported case for this specific circumstance, it should not be to much of a worry for most people. The information would be of significant importance to scientist developing vaccines, as this might lead to potential infection even after being vaccinated.</p>
